max.py PATH will condense the data at PATH into csv's that can be plotted.

logs.py -p -s geo PATH will graph the data in PATH (which has been processed by
max.py already) in bar charts. 


All the following scripts process the pmap tests, and take in a PATH that is the
location of the data. The script will cd internally to that location, since
initially the scripts were written within those directories.

ctime_scale/ctime_freq.py process redistribution time for either scaling or
frequency varying tests. ttime_* does the same but for the average turnaround
time. var.py plots the variance of transaction size for both systems. 

var.py is only configured for the scaling test.
