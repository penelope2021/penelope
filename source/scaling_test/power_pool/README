The major differences here are in the main method (more parameters) and in APIs.
We destroy the power reader thread and instead have a read_power function which
returns value based on the time since launch. It returns whatever the current
cap is until a certain time threshold is met, at which point it returns below
the minimum allowed cap to mock as though it is "idling".
